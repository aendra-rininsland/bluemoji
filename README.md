# Bluemoji! ðŸ’™ðŸ¦‹

This is the root of the Bluemoji mono-repo. It contains:

- **[/schema](schema/)** for the `blue.moji` schemata
- **[/lib](lib/)** The npm `@aendra/bluemoji` helper library for uploading, manipulating, rendering Bluemoji
- **[/lexicons](lexicons/)** The lexicon TypeScript definitions available at `@aendra/lexicons` on npm

Note that this is all very work-in-progress. You won't be able to see Bluemoji until
either Bluesky adds @aendra/bluemoji to the app or a 3rd party dev does similar.

I may also deploy a fork of the Bluesky AppView at some point but probably not
until OAuth support arrives.

In the meantime, you can play with Bluemoji at:
