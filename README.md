# Bluemoji! ðŸ’™ðŸ¦‹

This is the root of the Bluemoji mono-repo. It contains:

- **[/facet](facet/)** Extends `@atproto/api` so the `RichText` class can parse `:emoji:` strings
- **[/webapp](webapp/)** work-in-progress webapp for uploading and using Bluemoji on Bluesky

Note that this is all very work-in-progress. You won't be able to see Bluemoji until
either Bluesky adds @aendra/bluemoji to the app, a 3rd party dev does similar, or I finish the webapp mentioned above.

In the meantime, you can upload Bluemoji at:
