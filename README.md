# Bluemoji! ðŸ’™ðŸ¦‹

This is the root of the Bluemoji mono-repo. It contains:

- **[/schema](schema/)** for the `blue.moji` schemata.
- **[/api](api/)** The npm `@aendra/bluemoji` client library for uploading, manipulating, rendering Bluemoji.
- **[/server](server/)** In-progress server-side implementation.

Note that this is all very work-in-progress. You won't be able to see Bluemoji until
either Bluesky adds @aendra/bluemoji to the app or a 3rd party dev does similar.

In the meantime, you can play with Bluemoji at:
