# Summary

Sharing features for Bluemoji.

# Basic example

Users are able to share Bluemoji with each other, and provide multiple Bluemoji as a "pack".

# Motivation

This will facilitate adoption and make Bluemoji more accessible to users.

# Detailed design

Terminology

- _Bluemoji Pack_: A `blue.moji.pack.record` record, which is a user's curation
  of specific Bluemoji into a shareable pack, intended to function similarly to
  how Starter Packs work.

# Adoption strategy

The [@moji.blue Bluesky user][moji.blue] is intended to provide a number of
useful features, such as alerting whenever a new Bluemoji record has been
created and providing a link to let users copy new record to their repos.
Several custom feeds showing people using Bluemoji are also planned. It may
eventually provide usage stats as well ("Weekly Top Bluemoji", "Weekly Top Emoji
Copies", et cetera).

Additionally, Bluemoji Packs are intended to let users copy curated groupings of
Bluemoji provided by other users, similar to how Starter Packs let users follow
individual or every user from a curated list. This is hoped to give users the
ability to quickly and easily begin using Bluemoji without having to
painstakingly build a collection from uploading or copying individual records.
